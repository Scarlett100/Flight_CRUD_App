# Flight_CRUD_App
QA flask application with CRUD functionality

# Project Overview

Our task was to build a Flask application that utilises CRUD functionality. 
In my case I set to build an application pertaining to flights and aeroplanes. 
Users would be able to use this application to create their ideal flight, after doing so users would be able to view (read), update and delete their flight entries. 
These flights would be paired with aeroplanes, which also had CRUD functionality. 
For my minimum viable product I decided to create an application in which users were able to search for flights from London and view the details pertaining to these flights in real time (including delays & cancellations). 
I decided if I had time and complted my mvp I would futher my application by adding two more tables within my database (Customer and orders) which would then allow users to also complete booking flights on the same web application.
To do this I would first have to make a Trello Kanban board to decipher a realistic timeline then begin with my Entity related diagrams and Risk assessment. 
In order to do this, I would need to incorporate and execute my knowledge of Python, Git, Basic Linux, CI, Databases, Cloud Fundamentals and testing.




# Project tracking

Via the use of Trello a  Kanban board was created and  I began by entering all of the tasks I that had to be completed in order to achieve the minimum viable product. 
Once this was done I began putting label codes on each task following MOSCOW framework. In order to work in an Agile way, and thus provide better results I began planning sprint one.  
I worked by implementing an Agile methodology and followed the MOSCoW framework in order to prioritise and ensure reaching the goal of MVP.
As seen below, my Trello Board evolved over time, the first picture is from the beginning of the project, whilst the second is towards the end of the project.

This project required project tracking and I was able to do this via the us

# Risk Assessment

The risk assesment enabled me to foreesee any problems and how to handle them if they occured.

# ERD

I decided my mvp would contain two tables with the first being Aircraft with a primary key of aircraft_id and the second table being Flights with a primary key of flight_id containing a foreign key of aircraft_id.
