# Flight_CRUD_App
QA flask application with CRUD functionality

# Task
For my minimum viable product I decided to create an application in which users were able to search for flights to caribbean destinations and view the details pertaining to these flights in real time (including delays & cancellations). To do this I would first have to make a Trello Kanban board to decipher a realistic timeline then begin with my Entity related diagrams and  Risk assesment. I decided if I had time and complted my mvp I would futher my application by adding two more entites (Customer and orders) which would then allow users to also complete booking flights on the same web application.

(copy and paste task requirements or nah?)

# Kanban board on Trello

For my Kanban board I began by entering all of the tasks I was currently aware of that had to be completed. Once this was done I began putting label codes on each task following MOSCOW framework. In order to work in an Agile way, I knew I would have to create sprints.



# Risk Assessment

The risk assesment enabled me to foreesee any problems and how to handle them if they occured.
(date it). 


# ERD

I decided my mvp would contain two tables with the first being Aircraft with a primary key of aircraft_id and the second table being Flights with a primary key of flight_id containing a foreign key of aircraft_id.
